Udemy Clone - Responsive Web Design Project

I developed a fully responsive Udemy clone website using HTML and CSS, focused on creating a user-friendly, mobile-optimized experience. This project includes all the key elements of an online learning platform, such as course listings, navigation, and a clean, professional layout.

Key Features:

Fully responsive design: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Clean, user-friendly UI: Implemented a modern design with intuitive navigation and well-organized content for optimal user experience.
Custom styling with CSS: Employed CSS for precise control over the styling and layout of the website, ensuring a polished look across all devices.

This project highlights my skills in front-end web development, responsive design, and my ability to build practical web applications that are visually appealing and functional.
